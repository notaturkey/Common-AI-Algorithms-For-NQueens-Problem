# Common-AI-Algorithms-For-NQueens-Problem
## NQuenns 
The NQueens problem can be described [here](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/queens)
## Board Structure
To keep track of where I am placing a queen, I only focus on which column id place a queen then check if the board is valid. So for example if i had a 4x4 board with all queens in the first row, the array would look like: [1,1,1,1]

These 3 seperate python files all solve the NQueens problem but in different ways.
